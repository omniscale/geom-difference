geom-difference
===============

Calculate difference between two GeoJSON or Shapefiles. Can be used for change detection between to similar data sets.


Dependencies
============

    pip install fiona pyproj shapely rtree


Example
=======

  python geom_difference.py \
    --a-file=administrative_current.geojson \
    --b-file=administrative_previous.geojson \
    --result-file=administrative_diff.geojson \
    --src-srs='EPSG:25832' \
    --buffer=500


The result is always a GeoJSON in 'EPSG:4326'.
The resulting geometries can be buffered with ``--buffer``. The buffer needs to be in the same unit as ``--src-srs``.
